### Program explanation
```
First input is Restaurant Name which is in string. Then the Date is separated by Year, Month, Day, and Time. After that input Name, next input is the item and price. Which you can input it more if you press yes/Yes/YES/y/Y or stop it with other input to get the receipt output.
For the dot between item and price is calculated first in the first loop which dot has the fewer character. And that value become the reference for other item in the next loop which is name by finalDot. i make it like that so that the "Rp" can be in one line. The only flaw this program has is that when the text is more than 30 its not over to the new line and im sorry about that.
