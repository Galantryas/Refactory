### Program Explanation
```
i am using display flex to control the space except for the profile in right top im using display absolute. For the calendar space and task list im using box-shadow to make the area easy to watch like the original pic but the shadow i use is more wider and darker a bit. For the calendar and modal im not yet making it because not enough time for me to make it. And for the search currently it's just div box and not inputabale because the same reason. I'm really sorry that i can't finish this task within the time given.
